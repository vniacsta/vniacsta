### Hi 👋

### I'm Vania from Porto!

2020 has given me the opportunity to learn Front-End development, which I immediately loved.  
#codingisfun 👩‍💻  

Because I was so thirsty for more, I went all-in in Academia de Código Full-Stack Software Developer Bootcamp. I immediately found my path and a job that I love. 

I consider my best skills to be my adaptability to the work environment, teamwork and problem-solving. 
I love to learn, I’m always ready for a challenge, I’m result-driven, hands-on, and with a can-do mentality.

I’m a mom, I exercise and I’m vegan 🌱 
I want to spread a healthy message and contribute to a cleaner and better world for all!
